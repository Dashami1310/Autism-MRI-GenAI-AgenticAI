### Autism-MRI-GenAI-AgenticAI
GEN AI & AGENTIC AI APPROACH FOR IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION OF AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER IN MRI IMAGES

## Overview  
This project implements a deep learning based system to identify Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) from MRI brain images using Generative AI and Agentic AI concepts. ResNet50 with transfer learning is used for classification, Grad-CAM provides explainability, and a Gradio interface enables easy predictions.

## Dataset  
Kaggle – Autism Pre-processed MRI Dataset  
(Dataset not uploaded due to license restrictions)

## Model  
ResNet50 (Transfer Learning)  
Accuracy: 91%

## Tools  
Python, Google Colab, PyTorch, Grad-CAM, Gradio

## Sample Prediction Outputs

Below are sample predictions generated by the model with Grad-CAM visualization, showing brain regions influencing the classification.
