# Autism-MRI-GenAI-AgenticAI

GenAI and Agentic AI based approach for identification and classification of Autism Spectrum Disorder using MRI images.


## Overview
This project implements a deep learning based system to identify Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) from MRI brain images using Generative AI and Agentic AI concepts. ResNet50 with transfer learning is used for classification, Grad-CAM provides explainability, and a Gradio interface enables easy predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is taken from Kaggle:

**Autism Pre-processed MRI Dataset**  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dswainsonsujana/autism-preprocessed

Due to Kaggle licensing restrictions, the dataset is not included in this repository.


## Methodology
- MRI preprocessing (resize, normalization, RGB conversion)
- Data augmentation and synthetic data generation
- Transfer learning with ResNet50
- Model evaluation using accuracy and F1-score
- Grad-CAM for explainable AI
- Gradio interface for prediction


## Model Performance
- Model: ResNet50 (Transfer Learning)
- Accuracy: 91%
